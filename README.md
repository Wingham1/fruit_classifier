# fruit_classifier
A CNN to predict the kind of fruit in an image. This project uses a subset of the fruits-360 dataset freely available on the kaggle website for learning data science. The code developed in this project was to implement some of what I had learnt in the deep learning course on kaggle. The python script provided has a function to preprocess the images, builds and trains a model, saves a model to a '.h5' file, loads the model from the '.h5' file, makes predictions with the test set and measures the accuracy on the test set.
